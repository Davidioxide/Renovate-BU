    <h1>Something about me</h1>
    <p>Hi there I am Dave! Just like the title indicates, I am a person who is willing to get in touch with every field to broaden my horizon and experience. I am now studying 2 new languages and learning to draw by myself. I often find myself ignorant and na√Øve, and I long to experience and learn more, especially about history and mathematics. However, I also really want to dive into one field. I tried it before and I failed when I learnt drawing and programming, but now I believe college life is a brand-new chance to help me practice and achieve those goals.</p>
