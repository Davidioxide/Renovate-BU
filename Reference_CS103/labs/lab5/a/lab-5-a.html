        <h1>Beer Chicken</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1kg chicken</li>
          <li>3pieces of red pepper, arbitrary pieces of green pepper</li>
          <li>moderate amount of garlic and other spices</li>
          <li>all necessary sauces</li>
          <li>a can of beer and some sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><span>cut up</span> chicken into proper size, and <span>bask</span> them in spice wine and black pepper</li>
          <li>heat up your pot and pour proper amount of oil, then place chicken into the pot</li>
          <li><span>fry</span>the chicken for one minute and start to add sauces, like soy sauce and oyster sauce</li>
          <li>bask the chicken with beer, and the soup which should be just over the height of chicken</li>
          <li>if the beer starts to dry up, start to put spices and pepper, then <span>stir-fry</span> it for 3 minutes</li>
          <li>add only a tiny amount of sugar or vinegar, if you like, then put some green onion onto it</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is my favorite dish because I am the only one in my family who can cook this dish properly, and
          all family members enjoy it. It is very spicy, and even though it uses beer, children can eat it because
          the beer is evaporated during cooking, only leaves the dish with wonderful texture and smell</p>
